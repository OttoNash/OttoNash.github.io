        <p>Much time has been spent working on our smartwatch, and our ideas for hardware and interface have been prototyped and diagrammed time and time again. But required for funding to go any further was the problem or inconvenience that the smartwatch was such an amazing solution to. The market is flooded with fitness trackers, and at this point everyone who wants one has one. The only people who want a smartwatch because it’s a smartwatch are the enthusiasts like ourselves. We know how handy it is to be able to see notifications without pulling out a smartphone, and we feel aggravated when we look at our wrists and we realize we forgot our watch. However, we are not a stable market. There are relatively few of us and we expect high-end, high-quality products for a fraction of what everyone else is charging. Many of us have (or had) Pebble smartwatches, and for a moment that market was in our grasp. We could replace Pebble! But no, we would fall to the same fate sooner. So a new market had to be found. What can a smartwatch do that a smartphone can’t? At this point we are only left with fitness and health trackers. So, we’ve decided to change direction. The October smartwatch is being put on a shelf for later. In the meantime, we’re working on an app.
